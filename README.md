# Navigation-System

Note: This version is missing the Python Pygame plotter program which displays the map and allows the user to select start and end locations. Due to the fact that this project is for school assignment and the Pygame plotter is not my own work. I am not allowed to publish to my public repository. Instead I can publish the basics of the navigation system.
